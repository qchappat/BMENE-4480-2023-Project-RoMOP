1.  Create an account on Kaggle
2.  Import the notebook 1-smlg-dna2rna-svd.ipynb on Kaggle by creating a notebook and importing the file
3.  Add the following dataset to the notebook on Kaggle: [Multimodal Single Cell as Sparse Matrices \| Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabiencrom/multimodal-single-cell-as-sparse-matrix)
4.  Save and run the notebook twice: for SVD with 1000 components and SVD with 500 components
5.  Go to the output of the notebook once it was runed and saved and create two datasets with the output data (the dataset can be created directly in Kaggle): one for SVD-500 and one for SVD-1000
6.  Import the notebook 2-smlg-dna2rna-models.ipynb with the sparse matrices dataset, the two newly created SVD dataset and the following dataset: [Open Problems - Multimodal Single-Cell Integration \| Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/data)
7.  Run and save the notebook on Kaggle
8.  Create a new dataset with the output of the notebook
9.  Import the notebook 3- smlg-dna2rna-models-testing.ipynb with the previous datasets and the one just created
10.  Run and save the notebook on Kaggle
