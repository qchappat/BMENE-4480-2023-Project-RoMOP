# Robust Multi-Omics Prediction for RNA Expression & Protein Surface Levels

This repository contains the paper, presentation, source code, and tutorial for the RoMOP (Robust Multi-Omics Prediction) project focused on predicting RNA expression from chromatin accessibility data and protein surface levels from gene expression data.

## Contents

- `paper.pdf` - Full paper describing the project and results
- `presentation.pdf` - Slides summarizing project goals, methods, and key findings
- `source_code` - Source code for implementing RoMOP models
  - `Multiome` - Code for Multiome dataset (chromatin accessibility -> gene expression)
  - `CITE-seq` - Code for CITEseq dataset (gene expression -> protein levels) 
  
## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are from the [Open Problems in Single Cell Analysis competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/open-problems-multimodal).
